# Create a method that takes two arguments, multiplies them together, and
# returns the result.

# Example:
# multiply(5, 3) == 15

# ANSWER
# ======

def multiply(num1, num2)
  num1 * num2
end

puts multiply(5, 3) == 15

# Further exploration
# -------------------
# If the first argument is an array, the return value will be a new array
# containing the same elements as the array repated by the number of times
# as the second argument.
